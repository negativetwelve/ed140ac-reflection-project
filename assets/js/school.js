  title: 'Negative ELL Practices',
  content: "Many school situations involve the forceful assimilation of ELL's in to English speaking practice, lowering the Spanish language skills to a lower status. This can provide negative reinforcement for students' self-esteem and perception of their own culture. Many modern research focuses on how to approach ELL without giving the students a negative interpretation of Spanish and thus themselves, their families, and their culture."

  title: 'Parent Participation',
  content: "Projects that involve the integration of the home with the classroom are perfect for supporting ELLs with their language acquisition. Elements of home can be brought in through parent participation and home culture. For example, a student could bring in a recipe from home in their primary language. This allows acquisition of language (translation) with a sense of familiarity. This allows the student to feel more connected to the foreign language of English. Second, parents participation is helpful for the educational value of parent involvement, and allows for communal English language learning. Finally, when students engage with their home culture in the classroom (particularly in their home language), it gives value to a culture and language that is often invalidated and excluded from assimilatory, often English-only mandated classroom."

  title: 'Dual Language Instruction',
  content: "Another approach involves simultaneous instruction in Academic English and Spanish. Neither language is elevated to a higher “status” but are given equal weight. ELLs learn course material in Spanish and English, and learn English, Spanish, and other subjects in the process. Although St. Cornelius does not have a dual immersion program, many of the afterschoolers, especially the younger students, receive instruction in both English and Spanish. Many of the students speak Spanish in the home, and having a bilingual afterschool teacher allows them extra support to learn and play. It also allows for easy communication between parents, students, and teachers. Having bilingual teachers who are able to converse with parents in their native tongue is integral to fostering parent involvement, and for accurately communicating student needs. It also allows the students more opportunities for self expression with each other and the classroom, when not limited by language skill."

$('#community').popover({
  placement: 'left',
  title: 'Community',
  content: "Because of the ethnic enclaving of communities of color, many ELL students will come into contact (through ELL classes or general education classes) with other students who speak their home language. Through group or peer work, or even homework help, ELLs can receive help or “scaffolding” from their peers with better English language skills, which helps with acquisition. Community and peer support is often integral not only for acquisition of language, but for a simple peer support network, where there are other students that ELLs can engage with in their home, more comfortable language."

  content: "For instance, one St. Cornelius student (let’s call her “Marta”) is an ELL. Her friends help her with her homework and communication. They even act as translators for her when she speaks to teachers! They teach her English but speak to her in Spanish, reinforcing her value of both languages."
