  title: 'Negative ELL Practices',
  content: "Many school situations involve the forceful assimilation of ELL's in to English speaking practice, lowering the Spanish language skills to a lower status. This can provide negative reinforcement for students' self-esteem and perception of their own culture. Many modern research focuses on how to approach ELL without giving the students a negative interpretation of Spanish and thus themselves, their families, and their culture."

  title: 'Parent Participation',
  content: "Projects that involve the integration of the home (through parent participation, family culture, etc) with the classroom are perfect for supporting ELLs with their language acquisition. Firstly, bringing something such as a recipe in another language (which often requires their parents help), allows acquisition of language (translation) with a sense of familiarity. This allows the student to feel more connected with the foreign language of English. Second, parents participation is helpful not only for the educational value of parent involvement, but allows for communal English language learning between both the student and the classroom, and the student and their (generally non-English speaking parents). Finally, when students engage with their home culture in the classroom (particularly in the home language(s)), it gives value to a culture and language that is often invalidated and excluded from assimilatory, often English-only mandated classroom (particularly in US public schools)."

  title: 'Dual Language Instruction',
  content: "Another approach involves simultaneous instruction in Academic English and Spanish. Neither language is elevated to a higher “status” but are given equal weight. ELLs learn course material in Spanish and English, and learn English, Spanish, and other subjects in the process. Although St. Cornelius does not have a dual immersion program, the Kindergarten afterschoolers receive instruction in both English and Spanish. All of the Kindergarteners speak Spanish in the home, and because they are still in their early phases of English language acquisition, having a bilingual afterschool teacher allows them extra support to learn and play. It also allows for easy communication between parents, student, and teacher. Having bilingual teachers who are able to converse with parents in their native tongue is integral to fostering parent involvement, and for accurately communicating student needs. It also allows the students more opportunities for self expression with each other and the classroom, when not limited by language skill."

$('#community').popover({

  title: 'Community',
  content: "Because of the ethnic enclaving of communities of color, many ELL students will come into contact (through ELL classes or general ed) with other students who speak their home language. Community and peer support is often integral not only for acquisition of language (through group or peer work), but for a simple peer support network, where there are other students that ELLs can engage with in their home, more comfortable language."
